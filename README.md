## Meet the Audio Widget Overlay View by Cleveroad

You know, guys, we have become a bit obsessed with music recently. See yourself by checking our previous work on the Audio Visualization View library. Since we wanted to create a companion to our equalizer and add to the collection of Android widgets, the idea to develop a nice and convenient audio widget was born almost immediately. So if you have already developed a music player and you feel that you want to make it even better, then you’re welcome to use our library and enjoy the results.
